  <h1>Study Spots Around Campus</h1>
	<h2>By Shelby Spiering</h2>
  
 <p>Eastern Washington University is on the quarter system and those 10 weeks go quickly! Staying motivated and on top of school work is important. Instead of always heading to JFK Library, maybe venture around to some other great study spots. </p>
   
  <p>Venture around Patterson Hall! There are multiple cozy spots to post up inside this stunning building. You may just find a spot that keeps you feeling creative. It’s very accessible and each spot is different.  </p>
    
  <p>Don’t have to be an Engineer or Design major to go inside the Computer and Engineer Building. The very lowest floor has a quite great study area. You won’t be bothered with the noise of classes getting in and out of session. Also, one of the tables is a barrel! How fun is that?!</p>
      
  <p>Last but not least, the Communications Building. Of course there’s the main lobby area one could post up, but on the second level there is a room just for students. It’s great for group projects when the library is full. But SHHH, let’s keep this one a secret between us.</p>
